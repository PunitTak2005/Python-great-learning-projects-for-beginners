To load a .csv file in Python, you can use the built-in csv module or the pandas library. Here are examples of both methods:

Using the csv Module
Python

import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('example.csv', mode='r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    
    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)

Using the pandas Library
Python

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)

The pandas library is particularly useful for data analysis and manipulation, offering more functionality and ease of use compared to the csv module12.
