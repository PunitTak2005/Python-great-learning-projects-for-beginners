When working on Python projects for beginners, several features can significantly enhance the coding experience:

- **Automatic Indentation**: Python automatically indents code when starting a new block, ensuring proper structure and readability. For instance, pressing Enter after a colon (:) will automatically indent the next line.
- **Code Completion**: This feature helps by autocompleting function and class names, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Call Tips**: If you pause for a few seconds while typing, call tips will appear on the screen, providing helpful hints and information about functions and methods.

These features make Python a user-friendly language, especially for those just starting out.
