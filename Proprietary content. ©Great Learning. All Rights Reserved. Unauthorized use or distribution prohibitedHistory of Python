 Python was indeed invented by Guido van Rossum in 19891. He was inspired by his love for comedy movies from the late seventies, particularly the British series Monty Python’s Flying Circus2. He wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name for his new programming language, and “Python” fit perfectly2.

Here are some important facts about Guido van Rossum and Python:

Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer born on January 31, 19561.
He created Python while working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands3.
Python was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, with improvements like exception handling and interfacing capabilities3.
Van Rossum was known as the “Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL) of Python until he stepped down from the role in 20181.
Python has since grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity and readability.
